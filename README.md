Conversation and User Comments Analysis
This project is designed to analyze customer feedback by extracting insights from user comments and conversation data. The analysis consists of three primary stages:

Normalization
This stage involves deconstructing the data source into distinct conversations and individual user comments. By doing so, we create a structured format that allows for more granified analysis of the feedback.

Process Flow:
Data Ingestion: Load the raw data from various sources.
Identification: Recognize and separate different conversations based on unique identifiers.
Extraction: Isolate individual user comments from each conversation.
Storage: Save the normalized data in a database or structured file for further processing.
Text Preprocessing
Before analyzing the text data, it's essential to preprocess the content to enhance the quality of the text analysis.

Steps Include:
Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant characters, such as punctuation or special characters.
Tokenization: Break down the text into individual words or tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Eliminate common words that do not contribute to the meaning of the text.
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form.
Text Clustering
The goal of this stage is to group the preprocessed text into clusters of similar topics, which allows us to identify common themes or subjects within the feedback.

Clustering Process:
Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical data suitable for machine learning models.
Model Selection: Choose an appropriate clustering algorithm.
Training: Apply the algorithm to group the data into clusters based on topic similarity.
Evaluation: Assess the quality of the clusters and refine the model as needed.
Visualization
The final output includes a word cloud that displays the most frequent and significant words from the user comments, providing a visual representation of the prevalent topics.


To use the word cloud visualization, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed, such as matplotlib, wordcloud, and PIL for image processing.

Getting Started
